## Installation

You need to install ionic.

First of all you need to install NodeJS with npm.

I advise you to download [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Linux) or [nvm for windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases) (Windows)

You can install 12.18.3 (it's works for me):

```bash
nvm install 12.18.3

nvm use 12.18.3

npm i -g @ionic/cli
```

Now go to the project folder and tap this to install all dependencies :

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

You need to open a terminal and go to folder where contains the project.

```bash
ionic serve
```
